## Name That Test

An interactive tech talk/game show exploring how we can write better, more communicative tests.

### Background

I am a strong believer in "tests as documentation". My ideal is when enough clarity can be achieved with a well written test because when a test falls out of sync with production code, it does so loudly, by making your build fail. When comments, READMEs, and external docs etc fall out of sync with code, they do so silently, sitting in your codebase for who knows how long, waiting to one day confuse the hell out of your coworkers or even yourself.

Name That Test, is therefore a fun exploration into the following question: Can we write tests which describe how the code should work so well, that we can omit test names altogether?

This game show idea stems vaguely from a talk I did about how the linguistics subfield of Pragmatics can help us write better tests: [The Pragmatics Programmer](http://slides.com/shawndromat/pragmatics-programmer#/)

### Format

Every round begins by showing a test and asking the audience to "NAME THAT TEST!" and guess what the name of the test should be, based off of the test code. The tests are purposefully vague, misleading, verbose, or just generally bad. The idea is to spark a discussion
